# Guidelines:

Please adhere to the following:

* use snake_case (underscores).

* keep variable and function names descriptive.

* use curly braces in this format:

    {

    }

* keep function implementations 40 lines or under (for code quality compliance and simplicity).

* separate one-liners, that overflow, into multiple lines.

Thank you.
