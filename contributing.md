# Guidelines:

Please:

* Use C++11 and above.

* use snake_case (underscores).

* keep variable and function names descriptive.

* use curly braces in this format:

    {

    }

* keep function implementations 40 lines or under (for code quality compliance).

* separate long one-liners into multiple lines.

Thank you.
