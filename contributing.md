# Guidelines:

Please adhere to the following:

* Place a field of physics together in one file.

* Place float and double versions of functions in separate files.

* Use snake_case (underscores).

* Keep variable and function names descriptive.

* Use curly braces in this format:

    {

    }

* Keep function implementations 40 lines or under (for code quality compliance and simplicity).

* Separate one-liners, that overflow, into multiple lines.

* Only numeric fractions of 1 / 2 can be put as decimals, for clarity purposes.

Thank you.
